# memories
This is a simple MERN Stack project 
The App is call "Memories" and it's a simple social media app where you can post your amazing events in your life

Set-up:
- Client: Run ```npm i && npm start```
- Server: Run ```npm i && npm run dev```

This is a project that I learn and re-implement from [this](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6QREj8te1P7VSwhrMf3D3Xt4V6_SRkhu) tutorial series
